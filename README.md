# Receipts for Lovely Loveseats

This is an attempt to try and build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for our customers.

In this project, we're storing the names and prices of a furniture store's catalog in variables.

Then process the total price and item list of the first customer, printing them to the output terminal.
